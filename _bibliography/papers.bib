abstract = {Entanglement asymmetry, which serves as a diagnostic tool for symmetry breaking and a proxy for thermalization, has recently been proposed and studied in the context of symmetry restoration for quantum many-body systems undergoing a quench. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration in various symmetric random quantum circuits, particularly focusing on the U(1) symmetry case. In contrast to nonsymmetric random circuits where the U(1) symmetry of a small subsystem can always be restored at late times, we reveal that symmetry restoration can fail in U(1)-symmetric circuits for certain weak symmetry-broken initial states in finite-size systems. In the early-time dynamics, we observe an intriguing quantum Mpemba effect implying that symmetry is restored faster when the initial state is more asymmetric. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement asymmetry dynamics for SU(2) and ?2 symmetric circuits and identify the presence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect for the corresponding symmetries, respectively. A unified understanding of these results is provided through the lens of quantum thermalization with conserved charges.},

abstract = {Optimization problems are the core challenge in many fields of science and engineering, yet general and effective methods are scarce for searching optimal solutions. Quantum computing has been envisioned to help solve such problems, for example, the quantum annealing (QA) method based on adiabatic evolution has been extensively explored and successfully implemented on quantum simulators such as D-wave's annealers and some Rydberg arrays. In this work, we investigate topological sector optimization (TSO) problem, which attracts particular interests in the quantum many-body physics community. We reveal that the topology induced by frustration in the spin model is an intrinsic obstruction for QA and other traditional methods to approach the ground state. We demonstrate that the optimization difficulties of TSO problem are not restricted to the gaplessness, but are also due to the topological nature which are often ignored for the analysis of optimization problems before. To solve TSO problems, we utilize quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) with a possible realization on quantum computers, which exploits the property of quantum superposition to explore the full Hilbert space and can thus address optimization problems of topological nature. We report the performance of different quantum optimization algorithms on TSO problems and demonstrate that their capability to address optimization problems are distinct even when considering the quantum computational resources required for practical QITE implementations.},

abstract = {The presence of quantum noises inherent to real physical systems can strongly impact the physics in hybrid quantum circuits with local random unitaries and midcircuit measurements. The quantum noises with a size-independent occurring probability can lead to the disappearance of a measurement-induced entanglement phase transition and the emergence of a single area-law phase. In this work, we investigate the effects of quantum noises with size-dependent probabilities ùëû=ùëù/ùêøùõº, where ùõº represents the scaling exponent. We have identified a noise-induced entanglement phase transition from a volume law to a power (area) law in the presence (absence) of measurements as ùëù increases when ùõº=1. With the help of an effective statistical model, we reveal that the phase transition is of first order arising from the competition between two types of spin configurations and shares the same analytical understanding as the noise-induced coding transition. This unified picture further deepens the understanding of the connection between entanglement behavior and the capacity of information protection. When ùõº‚â†1, one spin configuration always dominates regardless of ùëù and thus the phase transition disappears. Moreover, we highlight the difference between the effects of size-dependent bulk noise and boundary noises. We validate our analytical predictions with extensive numerical results from stabilizer circuit simulations.},

abstract = {In the context of measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions, the influence of quantum noises, which are inherent in real physical systems, is of great importance and experimental relevance. In this Letter, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the effects of both temporally uncorrelated and correlated quantum noises on entanglement generation and information protection. This investigation reveals that entanglement within the system follows $q^{-1/3}$ scaling for both types of quantum noises, where $q$ represents the noise probability. The scaling arises from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuation with effective length scale $L_{\text{eff}} \sim q^{-1}$. More importantly, the information protection timescales of the steady states are explored and shown to follow $q^{-1/2}$ and $q^{-2/3}$ scaling for temporally uncorrelated and correlated noises, respectively. The former scaling can be interpreted as a Hayden-Preskill protocol, while the latter is a direct consequence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations. We conduct extensive numerical simulations using stabilizer formalism to support the theoretical understanding. This Letter not only contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between quantum noises and measurement-induced phase transition but also provides a new perspective to understand the effects of Markovian and non-Markovian noises on quantum computation.},

abstract = {Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous and computationally hard to solve in general. Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), one of the most representative quantum-classical hybrid algorithms, is designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems by transforming the discrete optimization problem into a classical optimization problem over continuous circuit parameters. QAOA objective landscape is notorious for pervasive local minima, and its viability significantly relies on the efficacy of the classical optimizer. In this work, we design double adaptive-region Bayesian optimization (DARBO) for QAOA. Our numerical results demonstrate that the algorithm greatly outperforms conventional optimizers in terms of speed, accuracy, and stability. We also address the issues of measurement efficiency and the suppression of quantum noise by conducting the full optimization loop on a superconducting quantum processor as a proof of concept. This work helps to unlock the full power of QAOA and paves the way toward achieving quantum advantage in practical classical tasks.},

abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) hold great potentials for near-term applications and are promising to achieve quantum advantage on practical tasks. However, VQAs suffer from severe barren plateau problem as well as have a large probability of being trapped in local minima. In this Letter, we propose a novel training algorithm with random quantum gate activation for VQAs to efficiently address these two issues. This new algorithm processes effectively much fewer training parameters than the conventional plain optimization strategy, which efficiently mitigates barren plateaus with the same expressive capability. Additionally, by randomly adding two-qubit gates to the circuit ansatz, the optimization trajectories can escape from local minima and reach the global minimum more frequently due to more sources of randomness. In real quantum experiments, the new training algorithm can also reduce the quantum computational resources required and be more quantum noise resilient. We apply our training algorithm to solve variational quantum simulation problems for ground states and present convincing results that showcase the advantages of our novel strategy where better performance is achieved by the combination of mitigating barren plateaus, escaping from local minima, and reducing the effect of quantum noises. We further propose that the entanglement phase transition could be one underlying reason why our RA training is so effective.},

We demonstrate the existence of DTC phase by analytical analysis from perturbation theory and convincing numerical evidence from observable dynamics. The new DTC model paves a new promising way for further experiments and deepens our understanding of DTC. Since the DTC order doesn't require special quantum state preparation and the strong disorder average, it can be naturally realized on the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware with much fewer resources and repetitions. Moreover, besides the robust subharmonic response, there are other novel robust beating oscillations in Stark-MBL DTC phase which are absent in random or quasi-periodic MBL DTC.},

Specifically, NNVQA feeds input (such as parameters of a Hamiltonian) from a given problem to a neural network and uses its outputs to parameterize an ansatz circuit for the standard VQA. Combining the strengths of NN and parameterized quantum circuits, NNVQA can accelerate the training process of VQAs and handle a broad family of related problems with varying input parameters with the pretrained NN. To concretely illustrate the merits of NNVQA, we present results on a NN variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for solving the ground state of parameterized ?‚Å¢?‚Å¢? spin models in one and two dimensions. Our results demonstrate that NNVQE is able to estimate the ground-state energies of parameterized Hamiltonians with high precision without fine tuning, and significantly reduce the overall training cost to estimate ground-state properties across the phases of the given Hamiltonian. We also employ an active learning strategy to further increase the training efficiency while maintaining prediction accuracy. These encouraging results demonstrate that NNVQAs offer an alternative hybrid quantum-classical paradigm to utilize NISQ resources for solving more realistic and challenging computational problems.},

Here we investigate MBL transitions in one-dimensional ($d\!=\!1$) QP systems as well as in random systems by state-of-the-art real-space renormalization group (RG) calculation. Our real-space RG shows that MBL transitions in 1D QP systems are characterized by the critical exponent $\nu\!\approx\!2.4$, which respects the Harris-Luck bound ($\nu\!>\!1/d$) for QP systems. Note that $\nu\!\approx\! 2.4$ for QP systems also satisfies the Harris-CCFS bound ($\nu\!>\!2/d$) for random systems, which implies that MBL transitions in 1D QP systems are stable against weak quenched disorder since randomness is Harris irrelevant at the transition.

Here, we propose a general framework using automatic differentiation to automatically search for the best QMC scheme within a given ansatz of the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which we call "automatic differentiable sign optimization" (ADSO). We apply the ADSO framework to the honeycomb lattice Hubbard model with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and demonstrate that ADSO is remarkably effective in mitigating and even solving its sign problem. Specifically, ADSO finds a sign-free point in the model which was previously thought to be sign-problematic.

abstract = {Non-equilibrium physics including many-body localization (MBL) has attracted increasing attentions, but theoretical approaches of reliably studying non-equilibrium properties remain quite limited. In this Letter, we propose a systematic approach to probe MBL phases via the excited-state variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and demonstrate convincing results of MBL on a quantum hardware, which we believe paves a promising way for future simulations of non-equilibrium systems beyond the reach of classical computations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Moreover, the MBL probing protocol based on excited-state VQE is NISQ-friendly, as it can successfully differentiate the MBL phase from thermal phases with relatively-shallow quantum circuits, and it is also robust against the effect of quantum noises.},
