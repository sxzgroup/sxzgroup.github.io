# Open Positions

<br>

We are always looking for talented individuals (undergraduate students, PhD candidates, postdoctoral researchers, and research assistants) to join us.

If you’re passionate about research along relevant directions and eager to contribute to cutting-edge projects, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I am open to discussions and look forward to exploring potential collaborations with you.

<br>

## Requirements

<br>

**Essential Skills:**

1. Familiar with quantum mechanics.

2. Understand fundamental concepts of quantum computing (quantum gates/circuits/measurements/channels/algorithms) and quantum many-body physics (band theory, second quantization, energy spectrum, Hamiltonian evolution, Jordan-Wigner transformation, etc.).

3. Familiar with at least one programming language and know basic concepts of scientific computing.

**Additional Desirable Skills:**

1. Familiar with quantum many-body numerical methods such as quantum Monte Carlo (VMC, SSE, DQMC), tensor network methods (DMRG, MERA, TEBD, TDVP, PEPS), exact diagonalization, mean-field approaches, etc.

2. Familiar with quantum (gauge) field theories as well as methods and concepts emerged in strongly correlated many-body systems.

3. Familiar with quantum algorithm design (NISQ or fault-tolerant), quantum error correction or mitigation.

4. Familiar with machine learning and scientific computing ecosystem and practice in Python.

5. Familiar with machine learning frameworks such as Jax, TensorFlow, PyTorch and machine learning paradigms such as automatic differentiation, variational optimization, just-in-time compilation, vectorized parallelism, and distributed training.

6. Familiar with engineering tools and paradigms such as GPU, CUDA, C++, HPC, Docker, DevOps, git, continuous-integration, software-engineering, cloud-computing, open-source.

7. Familiar with quantum cloud platforms and quantum software such as TensorCircuit, Qiskit, Cirq, Pennylane, Mitiq, etc.
