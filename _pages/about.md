Welcome to our research group! Our group is led by Prof. Shi-Xin Zhang at Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Our research is centered around **quantum physics and quantum computing**. Our current research interests include:

* **Quantum computing**: quantum algorithms, quantum simulation, quantum noise, quantum software, quantum information, with an emphasis on proposals ready for near-term quantum devices.

* **Non-equilibrium physics**: novel phases and phase transitions in out-of-equilibrium quantum systems, with a special focus on the entanglement and information perspective, covering topics including quantum chaos, many-body localization, time crystal, quantum scar, random quantum circuits, measurement-induced entanglement phase transition, information scrambling and protection, quantum Mpemba effects, etc.

* **Artificial intelligence**: the interplay between machine learning infrastructure / models / ideas and quantum physics / quantum computing / quantum engineering, quantum machine learning, with a special focus on developing new quantum many-body numerical methods inspired by machine learning philosophy and based on machine learning systems at scale.
